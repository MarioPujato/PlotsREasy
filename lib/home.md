  PlotsREasy allows you to obtain publication-ready plots of scientific data.  
  Graphics and statistics are performed with R packages and the output is readily available to download in PDF format, which is easily imported by the most common vector-based graphics packages like Illustrator (MACOS, Windows), CorelDraw (Windows) and Inkscape (MACOS, Windows, Linux).
